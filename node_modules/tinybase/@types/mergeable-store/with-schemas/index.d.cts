/**
 * The createMergeableStore function creates a MergeableStore, and is the main
 * entry point into the mergeable-store module.
 *
 * This has schema-based typing. The following is a simplified representation:
 *
 * ```ts override
 * createMergeableStore(uniqueId?: Id): MergeableStore;
 * ```
 *
 * There is one optional parameter which is a uniqueId for the MergeableStore.
 * This is used to distinguish conflicting changes made in the same millisecond
 * by two different MergeableStore objects as its hash is added to the end of
 * the HLC timestamps. Generally this can be omitted unless you have a need for
 * deterministic HLCs, such as in a testing scenario. Otherwise, TinyBase will
 * assign a unique Id to the Store at the time of creation.
 * @returns A reference to the new MergeableStore.
 * @example
 * This example creates a MergeableStore.
 *
 * ```js
 * import {createMergeableStore} from 'tinybase';
 *
 * const store = createMergeableStore('store1');
 *
 * console.log(store.getContent());
 * // -> [{}, {}]
 * console.log(store.getMergeableContent());
 * // -> [[{}, '', 0], [{}, '', 0]]
 * ```
 * @example
 * This example creates a MergeableStore with some initial data:
 *
 * ```js
 * import {createMergeableStore} from 'tinybase';
 *
 * const store = createMergeableStore('store1').setTables({
 *   pets: {fido: {species: 'dog'}},
 * });
 *
 * console.log(store.getContent());
 * // -> [{pets: {fido: {species: 'dog'}}}, {}]
 * console.log(store.getMergeableContent());
 * // ->
